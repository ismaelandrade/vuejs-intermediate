# SSR
The same client from project #2 went to a marketing course and
he was told that his site needed to be rendered from the server 
for a better SEO ranking (Search Engine Optimization)

He wants to separate the form to have its own page.

Also he knows about your jokes service and wants a pages showing 
a joke but also SSR.

Finally, the printer has been selling a lot because people found out 
they can pass a printed page through the other color printers
to create 2d images, so we need a place to buy replacement toners with
a shopping cart.
