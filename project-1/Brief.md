# Joke widget
The client needs a widget that will show a random joke in its website.
You started working that widget on a vue cli project, but you found out
that the client already has a PHP server running the site.

The widget should be able to show a new joke when clicking a button,
but it should not refresh the page, so thety want that logic done with JS.
